When the team rely on virtual assistants to complete tasks it is important the flow of information is managed in a way that everyone is kept up to date. The easiest way to explain this as an example is by having each property manager in a team all working from different rooms in a house independently of one another whilst still all relying on one particular admin person. This admin person needs to learn to prioritise tasks and update the team as required. However, to prioritise there needs to be conversations amongst the team in a structured manner. The best solution for us was another tech add-on called slack.
